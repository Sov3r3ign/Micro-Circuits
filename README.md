<h1> Micro Circuits</h1>
 <p>The system should keep track of <b><em>stock codes, stock prices and stock count in three separate lists.</em></b>
 The stock codes should be <b>string-based, the prices floating-point and the count as integer.</b>  To
 keep them competitive, their financial planner has advised them never to carry more than 50
 types of stock (according to stock code) at a time.</p>
 <p>The system needs to have a function called <b>AddStockCode().</b>  This function needs to prompt the
 user for a stock code and price and then add these values to the others already stored in the
 system.  Their advisor has also requested that no item may be priced higher than R 1000.00.</p>
 • To find a specific stock code, a search function is required.  Create a function called SearchCode
 to fulfill this function.  The function should receive a single string-based parameter, representing
 the stock code to search for.  The function must not do any unnecessary searching.  As soon as
 the search value is found, the search process should halt.  Upon a successful search the function
 must return the index in the stock code list where the value was found.  If the value was not found,
 display a relevant message to the command-line and return a suitable value.
 • Once the stock codes and prices have been added, it will be necessary to add stock to the system.
 Create a function called AddStockItem which will prompt the user for a stock code and the
 number of items to add.  This function should make a call to the SearchCode function to find the
 relevant stock item. To ensure that stock doesn’t get old in the shop, their financial planner has
 advised them that they should never have more than 100 items of any stock type (according to
 stock count) in the shop at a time.
 • From time to time, it will be necessary to check the stock list.  Create a function called
 DisplayStockList which will display every stock code, with its associated price, number of items in
 stock and total stock value for each item.  The list should also display the total value of all stock in
 the system.  The list should be displayed with a header in a format similar to the following:
 
Stock code, In stock, Price,Stock value 
AAA, 10,50,500 
BBB,5,20.00,100 
Total,,600 
To control the system, Micro Circuits wish to make use of a CLI-based menu with the following options:    
1. Add Stock Code
2. Add Stock Item
3. Display Stock List
4. Exit
   
 The menu should display continuously until the user decides to exit the program, i.e. after selecting 
options 1 to 3 and completing the activity the menu should always be re-displayed.  The program should 
only exit when option 4 is selected.
